# StudyCo App

Study Co. is a data-driven app that uses user feedback to help students find their perfect study spot. After users input their criteria, the app sorts through a database of study spots at UBC and recommends locations that fit their precise needs. Users have the option to report how busy their current study spots are, informing others about a location's availabilityâ€”similar to how the Transit app or Google Maps displays real-time conditions.
